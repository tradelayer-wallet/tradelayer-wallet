# Trade-Layer Wallet


This is the  stable MVP of the tradelayer wallet, please note that the wallet requires its own local node to run. Which can be downloaded from 
https://github.com/BlockPo/BlockPo-to-Tradelayer

The wallet is decentralized and thus cannot work without your own local node for signing. The sync time is around ~5 hours so please be patient! The exe comes attached with some build instructions. Find them attached here.
